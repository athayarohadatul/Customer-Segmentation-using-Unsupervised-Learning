# Customer-Segmentation-using-Unsupervised-Learning

This project explores customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques, particularly K-Means Clustering, on a customer dataset. The aim is to identify distinct customer groups for better decision-making in marketing strategies.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Customer_Data.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full workflow from data preprocessing to clustering and visualization.
- `Customer_Data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.

## 🎯 Objective

Segment customers based on their demographic and behavioral features such as age, income, and spending score to gain insight into different customer profiles.

## 🧪 Methods Used

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Scaling
- Elbow Method for determining optimal number of clusters
- K-Means Clustering
- Cluster Visualization

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 📊 Results

The dataset was successfully segmented into clusters that represent different types of customers. These clusters can be used to guide targeted marketing and customer engagement strategies.
